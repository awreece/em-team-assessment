# em-assessment
A series of questions designed to help an engineering manager assess a team.

Whether you've just inherited a team of engineers, or have been working with a team for a while and want to help transform it into a higher performing team, the questions below are intended to help you dive in to discover the strengths, weaknesses and opportunities for improvement.

* Is the work aligned with company goals? 
* What are the short term projects? 
* What are the long term projects?
